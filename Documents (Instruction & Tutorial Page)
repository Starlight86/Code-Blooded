To use and understand the instructions page on the website you simply need to be on the home page and select the instruction tab to view the HTML 
page with the information on it.

The code view is used to go to the templates folder and locate the instruction.html to view the info. To adjust either the page linking or the address 
go to the routes folder to adjust the /instruction/ section to the adjusted address and go to the base.html to adjust the page link.
