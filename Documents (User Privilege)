To access and use both the roles page and the admin page you will first need to login in with 
your user account. Then click the roles and fill in your user name with the title of the role you
want assigned. To access the admin page you will need to assign the role "admin". Once you access 
the admin page all your roles will be cleared and you will have to re-add the roles in the role
page.

In the code form, you can go to the roles.html under templates and adjust anything needed in the 
roles.html page. The methods below Assign Role is used to assign the user the roles inserted and 
is needed to allow the other code to function. The page access and role assignment are done within 
routes.py and the user.py page where routes.py has a creation and assignment for the role
while the user.py allows the role to be passed into the list and saved. When using the admin.html
page you have an if statement to check for the correct role to access the page and once it is 
correct it will clear the roles and let the user view the page.
