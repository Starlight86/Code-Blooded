## Team Rules
Rule 1 (Communication): The team must communicate when working on the project and must inform the others if they have trouble with the program or are unable to do a task.
Rule 2 (Documentation): When a team member works on the project and makes changes, they must document and record what they do. This ensures that should something breaks, the team can find and work on the change that causes this issue.
Rule 3 (Keep Calm): When a team member is having trouble with a project, it can be understood if they find it hard to manage. They should not be afraid to take a step away to cool their head or ask a teammate for assistance.
Rule 4 (Penalty): Should a team member violate any of the rules, they will receive a warning but if too many issues arise, the team may contact Dr. Cho.
